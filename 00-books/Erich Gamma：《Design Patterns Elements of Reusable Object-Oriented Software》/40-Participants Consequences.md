## Participants

• Component (Graphic)

– declares the interface for objects in the composition.

– implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes, as appropriate.

– declares an interface for accessing and managing its child components.

– (optional) defines an interface for accessing a component’s parent in the recursive structure, and implements it if that’s appropriate.

• Leaf (Rectangle, Line, Text, etc.)

– represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.

– defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.

• Composite (Picture)

– defines behavior for components having children.

– stores child components.

– implements child-related operations in the Component interface.

• Client

– manipulates objects in the composition through the Component interface.

## Collaborations

• Clients use the Component class interface to interact with objects in the composite structure. If the recipient is a Leaf, then the request is handled directly. If the recipient is a Composite, then it usually forwards requests to its child components, possibly performing additional operations before and/or after

forwarding.

## Consequences

The Composite pattern

• defines class hierarchies consisting of primitive objects and composite objects. Primitive objects can be composed into more complex objects, which in turn can be composed, and so on recursively. Wherever client code expects a primitive object, it can also take a composite object.

• makes the client simple. Clients can treat composite structures and individual objects uniformly. Clients normally don’t know (and shouldn’t care) whether they’re dealing with a leaf or a composite component. This simplifies client code, because it avoids having to write tag-and-case-statement-style functions over the classes that define the composition.

• makes it easier to add new kinds of components. Newly defined Composite or Leaf subclasses work automatically with existing structures and client code. Clients don’t have to be changed for new Component classes.

• can make your design overly general. The disadvantage of making it easy to add new components is that it makes it harder to restrict the components of a composite. Sometimes you want a composite to have only certain components. With Composite, you can’t rely on the type system to enforce those constraints for you. You’ll have to use run-time checks instead.

## Implementation

There are many issues to consider when implementing the Composite pattern:

1. Explicit parent references. Maintaining references from child components to their parent can simplify the traversal and management of a composite structure. The parent reference simplifies moving up the structure and deleting a component. Parent references also help support the Chain of Responsibility (223) pattern.

The usual place to define the parent reference is in the Component class. Leaf and Composite classes can inherit the reference and the operations that manage it.

With parent references, it’s essential to maintain the invariant that all children of a composite have as their parent the composite that in turn has them as children. The easiest way to ensure this is to change a component’s parent only when it’s being added or removed from a composite. If this can be implemented once in the Add and Remove operations of the Composite class, then it can be inherited by all the subclasses, and the invariant will be maintained automatically.

2 . Sharing components. It’s often useful to share components, for example, to reduce storage requirements. But when a component can have no more than one parent, sharing components becomes difficult.

A possible solution is for children to store multiple parents. But that can lead to ambiguities as a request propagates up the structure. The Flyweight (195) pattern shows how to rework a design to avoid storing parents altogether. It works in cases where children can avoid sending parent requests by externalizing some or all of their state.

3 . Maximizing the Component interface. One of the goals of the Composite pattern is to make clients unaware of the specific Leaf or Composite classes they’re using. To attain this goal, the Component class should define as many common operations for Composite and Leaf classes as possible. The Component class usually provides default implementations for these operations, and Leaf and Composite subclasses will override them.

However, this goal will sometimes conflict with the principle of class hierarchy design that says a class should only define operations that are meaningful to its subclasses. There are many operations that Component supports that don’t seem to make sense for Leaf classes. How can Component provide a default implementation for them?

Sometimes a little creativity shows how an operation that would appear to make sense only for Composites can be implemented for all Components by moving it to the Component class. For example, the interface for accessing children is a fundamental part of a Composite class but not necessarily Leaf classes. But if we view a Leaf as a Component that never has children, then we can define a default operation for child access in the Component class that never returns any children. Leaf classes can use the default implementation, but Composite classes will reimplement it to return their children.

The child management operations are more troublesome and are discussed in the next item.

4. Declaring the child management operations. Although the Composite class implements the Add and Remove operations for managing children, an important issue in the Composite pattern is which classes declare these operations in the Composite class hierarchy. Should we declare these operations in the Component and make them meaningful for Leaf classes, or should we declare and define them only in Composite and its subclasses?

The decision involves a trade-off between safety and transparency:

• Defining the child management interface at the root of the class hierarchy gives you transparency, because you can treat all components uniformly. It costs you safety, however, because clients may try to do meaningless things like add and remove objects from leaves.

• Defining child management in the Composite class gives you safety, because any attempt to add or remove objects from leaves will be caught at compile-time in a statically typed language like C++. But you lose transparency, because leaves and composites have different interfaces.

We have emphasized transparency over safety in this pattern. If you opt for safety, then at times you may lose type information and have to convert a component into a composite. How can you do this without resorting to a type-unsafe cast?

One approach is to declare an operation Composite\* GetComposite() in the Component class. Component provides a default operation that returns a null pointer. The Composite class redefines this operation to return itself through the this pointer:

class Composite;   
class Component{   
public:   
virtual Composite\* GetComposite() { return 0; }   
class Composite : public Component {   
public:   
void Add(Component\*);   
virtual Composite\* GetComposite() ( return this; }   
class Leaf : public Component {

GetComposite lets you query a component to see if it’s a composite. You can perform Add and Remove safely on the composite it returns.

Composite\* aComposite =new Composite;   
Leaf\* aLeaf= new Leaf;   
Component\*aComponent;   
Composite\* test;   
aComponent = aComposite;   
if(test = aComponent->GetComposite()) {   
test->Add(new Leaf);   
}   
aComponent =aLeaf;   
if (test= aComponent->GetComposite()) {   
test->Add(new Leaf); // willnot add leaf

Similar tests for a Composite can be done using the C++ dynamic\_cast construct.

Of course, the problem here is that we don’t treat all components uniformly. We have to revert to testing for different types before taking the appropriate action.

The only way to provide transparency is to define default Add and Remove operations in Component. That creates a new problem: There’s no way to implement Component::Add without introducing the possibility of it failing. You could make it do nothing, but that ignores an important consideration; that is, an attempt to add something to a leaf probably indicates a bug. In that case, the Add operation produces garbage. You could make it delete its argument, but that might not be what clients expect.

Usually it’s better to make Add and Remove fail by default (perhaps by raising an exception) if the component isn’t allowed to have children or if the argument of Remove isn’t a child of the component, respectively.

Another alternative is to change the meaning of “remove” slightly. If the component maintains a parent reference, then we could redefine Component::Remove to remove itself from its parent. However, there still isn’t a meaningful interpretation for a corresponding Add.

5. Should Component implement a list of Components? You might be tempted to define the set of children as an instance variable in the Component class where the child access and management operations are declared. But putting the child pointer in the base class incurs a space penalty for every leaf, even though a leaf never has children. This is worthwhile only if there are relatively few children in the structure.

6 . Child ordering. Many designs specify an ordering on the children of Composite. In the earlier Graphics example, ordering may reflect front-to-back
